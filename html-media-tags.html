    <h1>HTML5 Tags - Video, Audio, and Canvas</h1>

    <p>The HTML5 Video Tag allows a video to be played in the browser without needing any plugins as with previous
        versions of HTML. It appears as an embedded video in the webpage, as shown below.</p>
    <video width='400' controls>
        <source src='file_example_MP4_480_1_5MG.mp4' type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
    </video>


    <p>The text between the opening and closing tags of video, audio, or canvas does not appear in the browser unless it
        is not supported in that browser.</p>

    <p>The HTML5 Audio Tag allows an audio file to be played in the browser, again without needing any plugins as was
        needed in previous versions of HTML. It is also embedded into the browser, as shown below.</p>
    <audio controls>
        <source src='file_example_MP3_700KB.mp3' type='audio/mp3'>
        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
    </audio>


    <p>The HTML5 Canvas Tag is used as a container to hold graphics on a webpage. Keep in mind that since this is jsut a
        container, the graphics must still be drawn using JavaScript apart from using the Canvas tag.</p>
    <p>Below I have used Javascript to draw a linear gradient, and that is held within the canvas tag that I created.
        You are able to set the width and height of the tag as an attribute.</p>
    <canvas id='gradient' width='200' height='200'>

        Your browser does not support HTML5 canvas.
    </canvas>

    <script>
        var c = document.getElementById("gradient");
        var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
        // Create gradient
        var grd = ctx.createLinearGradient(0, 0, 200, 0);
        grd.addColorStop(0, "red");
        grd.addColorStop(1, "white");
        // Fill with gradient
        ctx.fillStyle = grd;
        ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 80);
    </script>
